Quote,"Does the quote contain the professional's complete information (company name, SIRET, address, legal notices, ten-year insurance)?",Vision AI will check,,,"Can user modify (add/change) some information in the documents?
if the user modify the values in the document do we need to create a new PDF file with the changes applied ?

Do we need to extract the information or only validate based on the questions?
","1. Can the user modify (add/change) information in the documents?
➤ Answer: NO. The controller (user) cannot modify any values inside the documents themselves. The scanned documents you receive are final, signed documents (by the client and the installer) and must not be altered.
2. If a value is incorrect, do we need to create a new PDF?
➤ Answer: NO. If the controller sees that the AI extracted a wrong value, the controller only corrects the extracted fields in the interface, not the documents. There is no PDF regeneration. If the dossier is refused, the installer must correct their own documents and resubmit new updated PDFs.
3. Do we need to extract information or only validate based on questions?
➤ Answer: The AI must extract all information from the documents. The workflow is:
IA reads and extracts all fields from the provided documents.
Controller reviews these extracted values.
If the AI made a mistake, the controller corrects the field (in the form/UI).
The system then runs the rules/validations based on these corrected fields.
The controller accepts or refuses the dossier.
If refused, the installer must update the real documents and resubmit them."
